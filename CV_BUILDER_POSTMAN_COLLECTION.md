| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `base_url`         | API base URL             | `http://localhost:3000`                   |
| `auth_token`       | JWT authentication token | `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` |
| `user_id`          | Current user's UUID      | `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`    |
| `personal_info_id` | Personal info record ID  | `personal-info-uuid`                      |
| `skill_id`         | Skill record ID          | `skill-uuid`                              |

## üìù Testing Workflow

### 1. Authentication Setup

1. Run the login request to get your JWT token
2. Set the `auth_token` environment variable
3. Set the `user_id` environment variable

### 2. CV Sections Configuration (Admin Only)

1. Update CV section configurations as needed
2. Verify sections are active/inactive as expected

### 3. Personal Information

1. Create/update personal information
2. Verify retrieval works correctly

### 4. Skills Management

1. Create multiple skills with different categories
2. Test pagination and filtering
3. Update and delete skills

### 5. Experience Management

1. Create experience entries with technologies
2. Test the technology validation (technologies must exist in Technologies service)
3. Verify CRUD operations

### 6. Other Sections

1. Test education, certifications, awards, interests, and references
2. Verify all CRUD operations work correctly

### 7. Complete CV Generation

1. Test the complete CV endpoint
2. Verify all active sections are populated

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Technology Validation**: When creating experience entries, ensure all technologies exist in the Technologies service first
2. **Admin Access**: CV section management requires ADMIN role
3. **User Ownership**: Users can only manage their own CV data
4. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
5. **Data Types**: Dates should be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
6. **Skill Levels**: Skills use 0-100 scale for proficiency levels
7. **Seniority Levels**: Experience uses predefined enum values (JUNIOR, MID, SENIOR, LEAD, MANAGER, DIRECTOR, CTO)

## üöÄ Performance Testing

### Pagination Testing

- Test with different page sizes (1, 10, 50, 100)
- Verify pagination metadata (next, prev, total)
- Test edge cases (last page, empty results)

### Filtering Testing

- Test search queries with different lengths
- Test category/company/institution filters
- Test combinations of multiple filters

### Bulk Operations

- Create multiple records to test pagination
- Test filtering with large datasets
- Verify performance with complex queries

---

**Happy Testing! üéØ**

This collection covers all CV Builder service endpoints with realistic examples and comprehensive testing scenarios.
